This project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars using a linear regression model. It involves data preprocessing, handling outliers and missing values, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Training Set**: 50,000+ rows with labeled car prices.
- **Test Set**: 1,600 rows for which the prices were predicted.
- Features include:
  - Car brand and model
  - Year of manufacture
  - Distance driven
  - Fuel type
  - Transmission
  - Engine power
  - Door count
  - Seat count

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing

Steps involved:

- **Dropped irrelevant columns**: e.g., `body_type`.
- **Missing values handled**:
  - `engine_power`: filled with **median**.
  - `door_count`: filled with **mode** (4.0).
  - `Distance`: rows with missing values were **dropped**.
- **Outlier Removal**: Extreme values were excluded to reduce model distortion.
- **Data Cleaning**: Verified and corrected datatypes and formatting for modeling.

## 🧠 Modeling

- Model Used: **Linear Regression**
- Library: `scikit-learn`
- Steps:
  1. Data split into training and testing sets.
  2. Linear regression applied to learn from training data.
  3. Predictions generated for the test set (1,600 records).


## 📈 Evaluation

- **Metric**: R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- **Training Score**: `0.6999`  
  This indicates that the model explains approximately 70% of the variability in the training data.
- Interpretation: This is a strong baseline for a linear regression model. There's room for improvement using more advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).


## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (if used for visualization)
